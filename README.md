# Games-Rental
A game rental system provides an easy and cost-effective way to try out new games without
having to buy every one.
Game rental is a risk-free way to try new games. Because it's so much cheaper than buying.
Each game has a vendor who has the responsibility of developing the game.
The admin of the system is responsible for adding the games to be rented out by the clients.

- Signing up a new user (e.g. admin, client)

- Adding a game (by admin)
- Updating a game details (by admin)
- Browsing games
- Showing a list of games that satisfy certain criteria (e.g. year, vendor, category...)
